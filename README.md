## Overview

This is an addon for Anki (http://ankisrs.net/) to convert Vocabulary Builder flashcards from an Amazon Kindle into an Anki deck.

It is still very much a work in progress and a learning opportunity for me. Please don't hesitate to share your thoughts or advice.  

## Notes

It does require you to install the Wordnik api python client (for now).

To get wordnik-python just:

```sh
$ easy_install wordnik
$ pip install wordnik
```
